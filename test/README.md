# CMEC test script

This script uses the python cmec-driver to run the register, list, run, and unregister commands for a fake module with fake data. It is a quick way to validate the basic functionality of cmec-driver.py.

## Before running:
Make any desired changes to the fake modules in the main method. The test module assumes it is being run from within the cmec-driver/test directory.

## To run:
`python cmec-test.py`

## Outputs
Check cmec-driver/test/output/[fake module name] for test outputs.
